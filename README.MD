# Responsive Recipe Layout

An app to display a random recipe from an api on load in a responsive layout.

## Improvements

Had there been no time constraints, the next steps would have been to:
- Connect up the serving size input to call the /ingredients/raw endpoint, use the data to create weights/measurements for 1 serving, then multiply that by the users input number of servings to rerender the ingredients list with new weights/measurements. 
- Add spinners or some form of loading feedback for users with poor connections
- Add unit testing for the javascript methods in app.js
- Add css variables
